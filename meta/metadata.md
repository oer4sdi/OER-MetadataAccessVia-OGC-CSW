## Abstract

This repository contains all the materials used to create and publish an Open Educational Resource (OER) on working with Copernicus data and openEO. The OER module provides a) some background information on OGC Catalog Services (CSW) and b) a practical exercise on how to access the OGC CSWs with different methods. 

### Content:
* Chapter 1: Overview
* Chapter 2: Background on the OGC CSW
* Chapter 3: Practical exercise on accessing OGC CSWs with different methods
* Chapter 4: Wrap up and summary

The OER is designed for students and professionals who want to improve their skills in working with Catalog Services. Users should have some basic knowledge of Python and it would not be bad to have some experience with Docker and Jupyter notebooks as well. However, the OER guides you through all these technologies and can also be used to gain some initial practical experience with them. 

### How to use the OER Module

Simply download the [PDF file](/Storyboard_OER-MetadataAccessVia-OGC-CSW.pdf), read and follow the tutorial..
